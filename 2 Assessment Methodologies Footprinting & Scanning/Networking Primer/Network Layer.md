# Network Layer Fundamentals for Penetration Testing

## Overview

The network layer (Layer 3 of the OSI model) is crucial for understanding how port scanning and host discovery work. This layer handles logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding between devices across different networks.

## Core Network Layer Functions

### Primary Responsibilities

- **Logical Addressing**: Assigns unique IP addresses to devices
- **Routing**: Determines optimal paths for data transmission
- **Packet Forwarding**: Moves data between source and destination across networks
- **Fragmentation/Reassembly**: Breaks large packets into smaller fragments when needed

### Key Protocols

#### IP (Internet Protocol)

**IPv4**

- 32-bit addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- Still the predominant version
- Finite address space led to IPv6 development

**IPv6**

- 128-bit addresses in hexadecimal notation
- Vastly larger address space
- Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

#### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

- Used for error reporting and diagnostics
- Essential for host discovery (`ping` utility)
- Supports traceroute and network diagnostics

#### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- Automatically assigns IP addresses to network devices
- Eliminates manual IP configuration
- Common in Wi-Fi networks and modern LANs

## IP Packet Structure

### Header Components

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│    IP Header    │     Payload     │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Key Header Fields

- **Version**: IP version (4 for IPv4, 6 for IPv6)
- **Header Length**: Size of IP header (typically 20-60 bytes)
- **TTL (Time to Live)**: Prevents infinite packet looping
- **Protocol**: Identifies next layer protocol (TCP=6, UDP=17, ICMP=1)
- **Source/Destination IP**: 32-bit addresses for routing
- **Flags**: Control packet fragmentation
- **Identification**: Helps reassemble fragmented packets

## IP Addressing Types

### Communication Methods

- **Unicast**: One-to-one communication
- **Broadcast**: One-to-all within a subnet
- **Multicast**: One-to-many to selected devices

### Special IPv4 Addresses

- `0.0.0.0` - Current network
- `127.0.0.1` - Localhost
- `192.168.0.0/16` - Private network range

## Subnetting and Network Segmentation

### Purpose

- Divides large networks into manageable subnets
- Enhances network efficiency and security
- Enables logical network organization

### Practical Applications

- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: Isolates public-facing servers
- **Internal Networks**: Separates workstations from external traffic
- **Security Zones**: Creates boundaries between trust levels

## Practical Analysis with Wireshark

### Installation and Setup

```bash
# Wireshark should be pre-installed on Kali Linux
# If not available:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireshark
```

### Basic Capture Session

1. **Start Wireshark** and select your network interface
2. **Begin capture** and generate network traffic
3. **Analyze packets** to see OSI layers in action

### Layer Analysis Example

```
Frame 66: 66 bytes on wire
├── Ethernet II (Data Link Layer - L2)
│   ├── Source MAC: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
│   └── Destination MAC: 11:22:33:44:55:66
├── Internet Protocol (Network Layer - L3)
│   ├── Version: 4
│   ├── Header Length: 20 bytes
│   ├── TTL: 64
│   ├── Protocol: TCP (6)
│   ├── Source: 192.168.1.100
│   └── Destination: 172.217.167.110
└── Transmission Control Protocol (Transport Layer - L4)
    ├── Source Port: 54321
    └── Destination Port: 443
```

### Key Observations

- **Encapsulation**: Each layer wraps the layer above it
- **Protocol Identification**: IP header specifies next protocol type
- **Address Resolution**: MAC addresses (L2) vs IP addresses (L3)
- **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time view of network communications

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Network Analysis

```bash
# Start Wireshark capture on your primary interface
wireshark

# Generate web traffic while capturing
curl https://www.google.com

# Stop capture and analyze:
# 1. Identify IP packets
# 2. Note source/destination addresses
# 3. Observe protocol fields
```

### Exercise 2: ICMP Analysis

```bash
# Capture while pinging a host
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8

# In Wireshark, filter for ICMP:
icmp

# Analyze ICMP echo request/reply packets
```

## Penetration Testing Relevance

### Why This Matters

- **Host Discovery**: Understanding how systems are identified on networks
- **Traffic Analysis**: Interpreting captured network data
- **Protocol Understanding**: Knowing how different layers interact
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing network issues during assessments

### Key Takeaways

- Network layer enables cross-network communication
- IP provides logical addressing essential for routing
- Packet structure understanding is fundamental to traffic analysis
- Wireshark provides practical visibility into network operations

## Next Steps
